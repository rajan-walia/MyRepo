//*********************************************************************************************************************************
Purpose of this exercise was to make NeuroMEM API written in C++ available in python. These API make calls [ through vcomm_ns4k.cpp]
to USB driver library provided by respective vendors [FTDI/Cypress etc] 
These files are generally available from the vendors website but you need to download and install and provide path for linker 
[such as -L/usr/local/include -lft4222] during compilation so that the approprate driver .so file is linked during compilation 
of _NeuroMEM.so file. 
Once you _NeuroMEM.so is generated please test it out
python3 
> import NeuroMem
> help(NeuroMen)
 ----<<...will spew out all the NeuroMEM API C++ functions available..>>
//*********************************************************************************************************************************

go		// Executable commands to generate .so file
NeuroMem.i	// SWIG input file
		// Other files that you see at thsi level are generated by excution of go
src/			// These are the "touched up" versions of the original files
	gvcomm.h	//	removed funcion decl. as we are #include'ing gvcomm_ns4k.cpp already
	gvcomm_ns4k.cpp //	changed byte to char 
	NeuroMem.cpp	//	#include "gvcomm_ns4k.cpp" added
	NeuroMem.h	//
