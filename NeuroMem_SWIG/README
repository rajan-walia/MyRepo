//*********************************************************************************************
Purpose of this exercise was to make NeuroMEM API written in C++ available in python.

SWIG has been used for this purpose. If you dont have swig installed on your system please
do "sudo apt-get install swig". [I assume you already have a g++ complier, python3 installed]

These APIs make calls [through gvcomm_ns4k.cpp] to USB driver library provided by respective vendors 
[FTDI/Cypress etc]. These files are generally available from the vendor's website. Please 
download and install these.

You will need to provide path for linker [such as "-L/usr/local/include -lft4222" for FTDI' USB] 
during compilation so that the approprate driver libfft4222.so file is linked during compilation 
of _NeuroMEM.so file. 

Once your _NeuroMEM.so is generated, you can run a basic sanity check as follows

python3 
> import NeuroMem
> help(NeuroMen)
 ----<<...will spew out all the NeuroMEM API C++ functions available..>>

//**********************************************************************************************

go		// Executable commands to generate .so file
NeuroMem.i	// SWIG input file
		// Other files that you see at this level are generated by excution of go
src/			// These are the "touched up" versions of the original files
	gvcomm.h	//	removed funcion decl. as we are #include'ing gvcomm_ns4k.cpp 
	gvcomm_ns4k.cpp //	changed byte to char 
	NeuroMem.cpp	//	#include "gvcomm_ns4k.cpp" added
	NeuroMem.h	//
